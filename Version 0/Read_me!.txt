Make sure you maintain version control, if you make changes and it works, 
add it to the new version folder rather than save over the source 
folder you pull the file from. 

Also if you have any notes to add, put it in here!

TravelingSalesman.py
-Run code and enter the location of the files to open
-Anything past 4 takes forever. Ran the file with the 14 vertices for 3 hours and got no result
-Algorithm is pretty much almost straight from the lecture notes

LongestCommonSub.py
-Needs major refinement(Generate Candidate function? Verifier function?)
	-The parts are there but kinda just stuff into the function itself
-Code is in good working order though, but extremely rough
-Need to make it accept arguments like the first program
-Need to try it with the text file included
-3 Loops :/
